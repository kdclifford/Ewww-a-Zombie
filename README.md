 # Backstory

This project was part of one of my modules for my masters. It required us to develop a Game in a week. 
We had a choice of using Unreal Engine or Unity. I chose to use Unity because I was more Familiar with the tools and layout of the engine.
Due to being more comfortable with the Unity I decided to pick a topic that would take me out of my comfort zone and improve my skills. I decided to 
start learning about inverse kinematics ("Inverse kinematics is the use of kinematic equations to determine the motion of a robot to reach a desired position.") due to the limited animations you could find online I wanted to be able to have more customize ability so if I had a spontaneous Idea of something to add then the worry of finding suitable animations would not be a problem.

In my eyes this was a win win situation because I could enter the competition with a possibility of winning, but also learn new skills at the same time.
